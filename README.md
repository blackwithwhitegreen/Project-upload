# VectorAsk-

VectorAsk is an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to query uploaded PDF documents using a retrieval-augmented question-answering system powered by a local Hugging Face model (google/flan-t5-base). The app provides contextual answers along with visual source page evidence rendered directly from the uploaded PDF.
